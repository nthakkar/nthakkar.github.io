My plan for this page is to give a general overview of my work at [IDM](http://idmod.org) and where I think it's headed, but it's still under construction. For a look at some specific disease modeling projects, check out the epidemiology sections of [actual ignorance](https://nthakkar.github.io/actual_ignorance/). For a higher level look at my work, see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4XfFTrEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) or my [CV](../assets/docs/CV.pdf).
